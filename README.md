   - **webpack.config.prod.js** - webpack config for creating the production bundle
   - **webpack.vendor.config.js** webpack config for creating the "vendor" bundle 
   (bundle containing all 3rd party libs)

* **start** - runs webpack dev server in hot mode [localhost](http://localhost:3333/) 
* **build:prod** - builds app production bundles
* **build:dev** - builds development bundles
* **build-vendor:prod** - builds production vendor bundles
